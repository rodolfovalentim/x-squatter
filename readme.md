## About

X-Squatter is a Python tool designed to detect and prevent Sound-Squatting attacks, a phishing technique that exploits similarities in word pronunciation to trick users into accessing malicious resources. Sound-Squatting has gained traction with the rise of smart speakers and audio-only content, making it an understudied but emerging threat, especially in multilingual contexts.

The tool utilizes state-of-the-art AI technology, including a Transformer Neural Network, to automatically generate high-quality sound-squatting candidates. This aids in the detection of domain name squatting abuse in TLS certificates and other types of squatting. Key findings show that a significant number of generated sound-squatting candidates are associated with TLS certificates, emphasizing the importance of countermeasures.
